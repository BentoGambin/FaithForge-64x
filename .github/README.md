Just an ordinary but definitely not a simple faithful edit. 64 pixels of pure rgba, and that's squared! per texture!

Normal and specullar mapping support is HEAVILY encouraged, POM is optional but also recommended.

    Recommended setup:
      Configs (in game):
        Clouds: OFF
        Natural Textures: ON
        Alternate textures: ON
        CTM: Fancy
        Trees: Smart

      Shader Configs
        Chocapic13's & Loop v2:
          POM depth Write: false (bugs out some models, mainly some Overlays, apotheosis bookshelves and fansmod ( 90%fixed ), if the last two are not present, it can probably be left as true);
