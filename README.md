Just an ordinary but definitely not a simple faithful edit. 64 pixels of pure rgba, and that's squared! per texture!

Mod support list comming soonâ„¢!     (I mean, if you really want it rn open the assets folder, if the mod name is in there, it is at least partialy supported)

Normal and specullar mapping support is HEAVILY encouraged, POM is optional since it's still in early stage.

  Recommended setup:
    Configs (in game):
      Clouds: OFF
      Natural Textures: OFF
      Alternate textures: ON
      CTM: Fancy
      Trees: Smart

    Shader Configs
      Chocapic13's & Loop v2:
        POM depth Write: false (bugs out some models, mainly apotheosis bookshelves and fansmod, if both are not present, it can probably be left as true);
