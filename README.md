# FaithForge 

Just an ordinary but not a simple faithful edit. 64 pixels of pure rgba, and that's squared! per texture!

Mod support list comming soon!      (I mean, if you really want it rn open the assets folder, if the mod name is in there, it is at least partialy supported)

Normalmapping and specullar mapping support is heavily encouraged, POM is optional since it's still in a very early stage.

This pack has some content from and based of https://faithful.team 's Faithful 32 Resource pack. Please don't re-release it and please send screenshots at my shaderlabs channel! https://discord.gg/RpzWN9S
